# Haenau Llwyd

A greyscale version of the [Haenau wallpaper](https://github.com/KDE/kdeplasma-addons/blob/master/wallpapers/haenau/) created by Marco Martin (mart@kde.org). It translates to "*Grey Layers*" in Welsh.

It is animated and changes with a 5 (instead of 30) second interval.

It is not available on the built-in wallpaper store, but you can drop `org.qaz.haenau_llwyd` in `/usr/share/plasma/wallpapers/` to use it.
